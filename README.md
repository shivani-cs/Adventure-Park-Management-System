# Adventure-Park-Management-System

We have designed a management system for an adventure park which provides training and joyrides for
three sports which mainly includes Paragliding, Bungee jumping and Scuba diving. The joyride is a one
day fare while training is for a duration of specified period.

The system is designed considering two views â€“
1. Customer View
2. Management View

The customer module consists of :-
* Registration if you are new customer.
* Viewing your account information if you are old customer.
* Payment
* Giving feedback

The management module consist of :-
* Log in according to your designation
* Viewing your profile if you are a trainer
* Viewing equipment details if you are equipment manager
* Adding a new employee profile or deleting an employee profile when he leaves his job if you
are manager
* Viewing customer details if you are manager
* Viewing report
